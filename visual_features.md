## Working List of Visuals to add

# Bubble Chart
A bubble chart with axes of AUC, accuracy, f1         
  score, and then each model as a point and the point size by how many parameters are a part of the that model.  
# Dimension Reduction
an embedding visualization using umap, t-sne, or that new library pymde.
- both render randomly sampled raw points and a contour distribution of each class for UMAP and other embedding visuals.

# DQN Policy Analysis
- Deep dive into the state space to prediction, alpha weighting histograms,
I also want some           
  investigating and visualizing the DQN policy, histograms on its weighting, and deeper dives into both the         
  state space of the latent representation of the GAT and VGAE
# VGAE and GAT analysis
Visuals pertaining the the specifc models GAT       
  and VGAE like reconstruction error, prediction outputs etc.
# D3 Force Graphs for preprocessed data
 The primary ones are a force graph to visualize graph      
  data samples,  .    


# Strong and Robust Visualization Practices and Conventions 
   And then continuing with strong coding practices of having figures follow config files, reusable assets as       
  top level components that indidivual plots and charts inherit downstream. So a strong and robust data             
  pipeline, and then a plan to increase the visualizations and a strong grammer and inheritence
