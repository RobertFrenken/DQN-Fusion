title: "Adaptive Fusion of Graph-Based Ensembles for Automotive Intrusion Detection"
subtitle: "Multi-Stage Knowledge Distillation with DQN-Based Expert Fusion"
abstract: |
  Controller Area Network (CAN) intrusion detection in modern vehicles must operate under diverse attack types, severe class imbalance, and strict hardware constraints. We propose a multi-stage, multi-expert ensemble graph framework that models CAN traffic using structural, temporal, and distributional cues. A Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) learns normal graph structure and guides targeted training of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) classifier. A Deep Q-Network adaptively fuses experts per sample. To enable deployment, a resource-aware intelligent knowledge-distillation (KD) pipeline compresses the ensemble into lightweight students, while curriculum imbalance training enhances rare-attack detection.

This paper presents a three-stage framework for robust intrusion detection on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Subsequent sections detail the [background](02-background.qmd), [methodology](04-methodology.qmd), [experimental setup](05-experiments.qmd), [results](06-results.qmd), and [ablation studies](07-ablation.qmd) that validate our approach across six publicly available CAN intrusion datasets.
