## About

KD-GAT is a three-stage pipeline for CAN bus intrusion detection that combines graph neural networks with knowledge distillation for deployment on resource-constrained automotive edge devices.

The pipeline uses:

1. **VGAE** (Variational Graph Autoencoder) --- unsupervised graph reconstruction to identify hard examples
2. **GAT** (Graph Attention Network) --- supervised classification with curriculum learning
3. **DQN** (Deep Q-Network) --- reinforcement learning fusion of model predictions

Large teacher models are compressed into small student models via knowledge distillation, achieving competitive performance at ~20$\times$ parameter reduction. We evaluate on six CAN bus datasets spanning DoS, fuzzing, spoofing, suppress, and masquerade attack types.
