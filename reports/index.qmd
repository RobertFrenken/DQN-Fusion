  We present KD-GAT, a three-stage pipeline for CAN bus intrusion detection
  that combines graph neural networks with knowledge distillation for
  deployment on resource-constrained automotive edge devices. The pipeline
  uses a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for unsupervised graph
  reconstruction, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for supervised
  classification with curriculum learning, and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
  reinforcement learning-based prediction fusion. Large teacher models are
  compressed into small student models via knowledge distillation, achieving
  competitive performance at 5--20$\times$ parameter reduction. We evaluate
  on six CAN bus datasets spanning DoS, fuzzing, spoofing, suppress, and
  masquerade attack types.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

::: {.callout-note}
This is a stub. Full content will be added in Phase 2.
:::

Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is the dominant communication protocol in
modern vehicles, connecting Electronic Control Units (ECUs) for safety-critical
functions. The lack of built-in authentication makes CAN vulnerable to
injection attacks.

## Pipeline Overview {#sec-pipeline-overview}

The KD-GAT pipeline consists of three stages:

1. **VGAE** (Variational Graph Autoencoder) --- unsupervised graph
   reconstruction learning (@sec-vgae)
2. **GAT** (Graph Attention Network) --- supervised classification with
   curriculum learning (@sec-gat)
3. **DQN** (Deep Q-Network) --- reinforcement learning fusion of model
   predictions (@sec-dqn)

Knowledge distillation compresses large teacher models into small student
models (@sec-kd), enabling deployment on automotive edge hardware.

## Datasets {#sec-datasets}

We evaluate on six CAN bus intrusion detection datasets. See @sec-evaluation
for full results.
